Collections of simple, single mini projects to train something new (Name is average - I know)

* first part of the course created by Piotr Gankiewicz  - amazing workout (http://piotrgankiewicz.com/courses/becoming-a-software-developer/

## What is the purpose of learning and what did I learn?

* a better understanding of the language C# and its aspects
* practice and repate training with CodeWars (fundamental, algorithms, operations on collections)
